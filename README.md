# CodeAlpha Internship - Projects Overview

Welcome to my CodeAlpha internship project repository! During my time here, I have had the opportunity to work on three exciting machine learning projects that I am thrilled to share with you. Each project has helped me develop my skills in data science, machine learning, and web development.

## ðŸš€ Project 1: Sales Prediction Model

### Overview
This project involved building a predictive model to forecast sales based on advertising spend. I utilized various machine learning algorithms and created a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions.

### Key Features
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset from `Advertising.csv`.
- **Model Training:** Explored algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed models using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics.

### Achievements
- **Top Model:** Random Forest achieved a Test Accuracy of 98.29% with a Test MAE of 0.596875.
- **Web Application:** Built using Flask for user-friendly interaction.

## ðŸš€ Project 2: Car Price Estimator

### Overview
Developed a web application that predicts the value of a car based on multiple input features such as kilometers driven, year of manufacture, and fuel type.

### Technologies Used
- **Flask:** For building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn:** To create the machine learning model.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive design.
